These examples interact with [Datasets API endpoints](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/datasets)
to explore available datasets. These are not scripts, but rather example statements for interacting
with the various API endpoints.

[full-datasets.py](./full-datasets.py) shows how to find and download full datasets.

[sample-datasets.py](./sample-datasets.py) shows how to find and inspect a smaller 
sample of the full datasets to explore and get an idea of the data shape within.
